                heading: 'Strawberry Leaf Scorch',
                summary: `Leaf scorch symptoms are very similar to the early stages of common (Mycosphaerella) leaf spot, with irregular dark purple spots being scattered over the upper leaf surface. As the spots enlarge, they begin to look like drops of tar, and are actually the accumulations of black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus. The centers of the spots remain purple (in Mycosphaerella leaf spot they are white) and there is no well-defined lesion border. In heavy infections, these regions coalesce and the tissue between the lesions often takes on a purplish to bright red color that is dependent on cultivar, temperature, or other factors. The leaves eventually turn brown, dry up, and curl at the margins giving the leaf a scorched appearance. Examination of the acervuli and conidial morphology can help to distinguish between leaf spot and leaf scorch at this advanced stage of disease. On the upper leaf surfaces of leaf scorch lesions, the acervuli are dark with glistening spore masses and dark apothecia. Petiole lesions are elongate, sunken, with a purplish to brown color and can kill the leaf by girdling the petiole. Runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps can also become infected. Plants may become weakened and the number and vigor of crowns reduced. Infection predisposes the plants to winter and drought stress. In severe infestations, flowers and fruit may die. Overall, there can be a serious reduction in yield in matted row systems. It has not been observed as a yield-reducing problem in annual production systems. In matted row or perennial strawberry systems, select a planting site with good air drainage and sun exposure. Cultivars resistant to leaf scorch may be available and need to be evaluated for specific horticultural characteristics. Plant new transplants frequently, and allow adequate spacing between them to increase airflow. Control weeds. Avoid amendment with supplemental nitrogen in spring, as this may enhance disease. Keep moisture levels down and avoid long wetness periods by monitoring irrigation schedules; if possible, use drip irrigation rather than overhead. Remove foliage and crop residues after picking or at renovation to remove inoculum and delay disease increase in late summer and fall. Fungicide treatments are effective during the flowering period, and during late summer and fall.
  
  In annual plasticulture production systems, the disease has not been observed to cause economic damage in fruiting fields and generally does not require action. Although symptoms may be on plants at the time of planting or soon after, the levels of disease are typically low and do not persist into the spring. In plug production facilities, high disease levels may affect the look of the plants and this decreased aesthetic value may impact sales. See our Strawberry IPM Guide at for current recommendations.`

                summary: `Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Symptoms of this disease include fruit spots, leaf spots, and twig cankers. Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit. Early defoliated trees are reduced in vigor and winter hardiness. Fruit symptoms of bacterial spot may be confused with peach scab, caused by the fungus Cladosporium carpophyllium, however scab spots are more circular, have a dark brown/greenish, fuzzy appearance, and do not pit the fruit surface, although skin cracking can occur. Scab does not cause leaf symptoms but can cause spots on twigs. Initial fruit spots of bacterial spot may be superficial but develop into craters.`

                summary: `As there are up to 11 different known strains of the pathogen, resistant varieties need to be resistant against all prevalent strains in an area. Sweet pepper varieties with resistance against all or multiple strains are available. A few of them are F1 of Autry, Green Flash, Labelle, Ninja, Outsider, Playmaker, Prowler, Raven, Samurai, SB3255 PB and Tracer. Additionally, Green Machine, Antebellum with X10R and 4288a with bs5+bs6 genes (intermediate resistance) can be used.

                The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas. It is prudent to grow own transplants under sanitary conditions to avo id importing bacterial leaf spot on seedlings purchased from off-farm sources. Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants, including your own. Buy seeds from a reputable company or treat your own seeds by following either of the methods described below.`

                heading: 'Potato Late Blight',
                summary: ` Late blight caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans is the most important disease of potato that can result into crop failures in a short period if appropriate control measures are not adopted. Losses in potato yield can go as high as 80% in epidemic years. During  past years, epidemics of the disease have appeared in 1985-86, 1989-90, 1992-93, 1997-98, 2006-07  and recently during 2007-08 season. Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler irrigation can favor late blight; in Tule Lake under solid set sprinklers, conditions conducive to late blight development are enhanced by day time irrigation but not night time irrigation.
  
                  Plant certified seed tubers. When late blight has developed on foliage and tubers are at risk of infection, make sure that vines are completely dead for 2 to 3 weeks before harvest. Phytophthora infestans does not survive very long in dead foliage.
                  
                  In districts that are commonly subjected to outbreaks of late blight, preventive applications of fungicides are advised when environmental conditions are favorable for the disease. Continue fungicide applications at 7- to 10-day intervals as conditions require. Shorter intervals may be needed under cool, rainy conditions. In interior districts where late blight occurs sporadically, watch for disease symptoms during routine field monitoring, and record your results (example form—PDF). Apply fungicides when late blight lesions appear in the field or in nearby plantings.`

                heading: 'Potato Early Blight Disease',
                summary: `Early blight is primarily a disease of stressed or senescing plants. Symptoms appear first on the oldest foliage. Affected leaves develop circular to angular dark brown lesions 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3–4 mm) in diameter. Concentric rings often form in lesions to produce characteristic target-board effect. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Infected tubers show a brown, corky dry rot. Early blight can be minimized by maintaining optimum growing conditions, including proper fertilization, irrigation, and management of other pests. Grow later maturing, longer season varieties. Fungicide application is justified only when the disease is initiated early enough to cause economic loss. Watch for disease symptoms during routine monitoring, and keep records of your results (example form—PDF). When justified, apply fungicides as soon as symptoms appear; continued protection requires application at 7- to 10-day intervals.`

                summary: `Chemical management is very popular strategy for the management of late blight. Since the discovery of Bordeaux mixture in 1885 and it was first important landmark in the history of chemical disease control. Bordeaux mixture belongs to first generation of fungicides along with other inorganic chemicals. After more than 130 years, the introduction of Bordeaux mixture (Copper sulfate, hydrated lime and water), large numbers of fungicides (first generation Bordeaux mixture to fourth generation Mandipropamid & Azoxystrobin) were evaluated at worldwide against late blight of potato/tomato. In practice, the traditional management of late blight depends highly on preventative fungicides, application on a regular calendar basis (e.g. weekly) during the growing season [30]. The population diversity and disease incidence of P. infestans has been increased through the development of systemic fungicide resistance (insensitivity) and the transcontinental shipment of the late blight infected potato tubers and tomato plantlets [31]. Metalaxyl fungicide which comes under Phenylamide group with FARC 4, was introduced against oomycetes, very effective for late blight management and highly adopted worldwide.`

                The apple scab fungus has several host-specific strains that can cause disease on one type of plant but not any other. For example, the strain of V. inaequalis that infects mountain ash will only infect other mountain ash trees and will not infect crabapple trees. Apple and crabapple trees are infected by the same strain of the apple scab fungus because the trees are in the same genus.`

                summary: `
Sawfly larvae feed on the surface of leaves of their respective host plant, removing the soft tissue leaving behind the papery, translucent surface and veins. Heavy defoliation gives plants a brown scorched appearance. In general, light to moderate infestations are cosmetic in nature and rarely harm the host plant. Heavier attacks, however, can weaken plants when leaf loss stresses them to the point of vulnerability to other insect and disease attacks.

1. Check plants for signs of infestation. Early detection can often result in simple cultural control measures. Begin looking for sawfly larvae in mid-spring (rose sawflies) or early summer (pear sawflies). Inspect both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. For light infestations, remove the infested leaves and destroy the larvae. A forceful spray of water out of a garden hose can also provide control by knocking off and killing many of the soft-bodied larvae. Be sure to aim the water at both upper and undersides of leaves. Continue checking plants throughout the growing season.

2. Support natural enemies of sawflies by responsible pesticide usage. Insects such as parasitic wasps, insectivorous birds, small mammals, predaceous beetles, as well as fungal and viral diseases all assist in keeping sawfly populations lower. Restraint in the use of pesticides allows beneficial species to assist your control efforts.

3. Use an Insecticide. Chemical controls are also available, but should only be used when necessary, not routinely as a preventive measure. Horticultural oil, insecticidal soaps, neem oil, bifenthrin, carbaryl, malathion, permethrin, cyfluthrin, imidacloprid, and acephate can all be used to control sawflies. Apply pesticides only when larvae are actually present, before infestations reach critical levels. Always be careful to read the label directions fully before applying any pesticide, and follow directions completely. Not effective: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a commonly used biological insecticide that offers control of many caterpillars, is NOT effective against sawfly larvae.

                summary: `Many home gardeners turn to neem oil as a treatment for infestations of mites, fungus and other plant diseases. Neem oil is distilled from the seeds of the neem tree and is a naturally occurring fungicide and pesticide. Used for hundreds of years as a treatment for agricultural issues, neem oil tends to have a sulfurous and garlicky smell.

Neem oil should not be applied if the roses are under stress due to drought so make sure to water them thoroughly a few days before applying the oil. Follow directions on the package and make sure not to apply neem oil when the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Neem oil should not be applied within 30 days of having treated the plants with any sort of sulfur product. Do not apply neem oil to wet or damp plants and make sure that the humidity levels are moderate. It is best to apply neem oil to a small test section of the plant and wait 48 hours to make sure that the plant can tolerate the treatment. 

How to Prevent Rose Rust
Now that we have covered how to treat rust once it has attacked your roses, we will go over some methods of prevention so that it will not become a problem again going forward. There are many simple methods to help keep your roses healthy that can not only help them avoid illness, but can lead to stronger plants and better blooms. 

Plant Roses in Full Sun
For most varieties of roses, more sun means more happiness. Better exposure to sun also helps keep vegetation drier and can even kill off fungal spores.

Space Plants Well
Plant roses so that they are well spaced for good ventilation as well as preventing the spread of disease. Rose canes should not be touching from plant to plant and this also allows the gardener access to the plant from all sides for maintenance and treatment. 

Water From Below
We can't help where the rain comes from, but when watering roses, make sure to water at the roots or use a soaker hose system. Avoid splashing when watering to keep spore movement to a minimum. Save those sprinklers for the yard — or for the kids to play in. 

Only Work with Dry Plants
When heading out to prune, deadhead or collect blooms, make sure that the plants are dry. Working with damp plants is an easy way to spread fungal spores as well as other types of disease.
